# Legacy Omarchy Overrides

This directory preserves files migrated from the old `~/dotfiles/omarchy` tree.

- Active Hyprland overrides now live at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland-overrides.conf` in the `arch` package.
- A snapshot of the active migrated override file is saved as `hyprland-overrides.conf.migrated-active`.
- These files are kept for reference/history and are not loaded directly by current runtime config.
